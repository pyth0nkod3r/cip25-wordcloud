To be or not to be, that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
        the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles
        and by opposing end them. To die—to sleep, no more; and by a sleep to say we end
        the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
        devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; to sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:
        for in that sleep of death what dreams may come, when we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
        must give us pause—there's the respect that makes calamity of so long life.
        For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, the oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
        the pangs of despised love, the law's delay, the insolence of office, and the spurns
        that patient merit of the unworthy takes, when he himself might his quietus make
        with a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear, to grunt and sweat under a weary life,
        but that the dread of something after death, the undiscovered country from whose bourn
        no traveler returns, puzzles the will, and makes us rather bear those ills we have
        than fly to others that we know not of?
