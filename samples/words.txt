 Artificial intelligence is transforming the world in unprecedented ways. Machine learning
        algorithms are becoming more sophisticated, enabling computers to perform tasks that once
        required human intelligence. Deep learning neural networks are revolutionizing image
        recognition, natural language processing, and decision making. Cloud computing provides
        scalable infrastructure for AI applications. Data science combines statistics, programming,
        and domain expertise to extract insights from big data. The future of technology lies
        in the intersection of AI, robotics, and human creativity.
